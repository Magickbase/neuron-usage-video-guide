# neuron-usage-video-guide

During the development and testing of the Neuron wallet, we found that many documents were scattered everywhere. When we needed to test some complex functions, we often had to search for many documents to fully reproduce the functionality. Therefore, we created this repo to record and collect operation videos of Neuron's functional modules. We hope to share and pass on information through community co-construction, and reduce the threshold for using Neuron.

1. Of course, this document is also aimed at the community, so please try to choose the English interface when recording videos.
2. Please note that when uploading videos, you should pay attention to the video sharing platform. Some platforms have certain time limits on video storage, and the videos may not be stored permanently.
